# Reflection on Adventure Game Assignment

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?
The code consists of three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- **HTML**: Sets up the basic structure of the game, including elements for displaying questions and answer buttons.
- **CSS**: Provides styling to improve the visual presentation of the game, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the game's logic, keeping track of the user's current state in the story and dynamically rendering questions and choices based on user interactions.

## 2. What was my coding process?
I started by planning the storyline in the `ADVENTURE_PLAN.md` document. After that, I created the HTML structure in a separate branch and ensured it was set up for dynamic content updates. Once the HTML was complete, I implemented the JavaScript logic to handle state management and user interactions. Finally, I styled the game with CSS to enhance the user experience.

## 3. What challenges did I have?
One challenge was ensuring that the story branches flowed logically and that all choices led to appropriate outcomes. I addressed this by carefully mapping out the story paths during the planning phase and testing each branch as I implemented it in JavaScript. Debugging the event listeners was also a bit tricky, but thorough testing helped identify issues.

## 4. What would I do differently now?
If I were to start over, I would consider adding more complex features, such as saving progress or incorporating multimedia elements (like images or sound). I would also improve the accessibility features from the start to ensure a better experience for all users. Additionally, I might break the story into separate modules or files for better organization.
